## __Experiment__ | simple_webrtc_p2p

__As the title suggests, this is a mere experiment, a personal POC. It lacks important features and is not finished.__

The initial thought was to sync data: smartphone <-> desktop. As I love free (not as in free beer) software, this is an Proof of Concept to open a bi-directional data channel between two browsers (almost) without 3rd party. The only time this experiment uses a 3rd party, is to punch a hole through the NATs of both parties if needed. This step needs to be included, as almost all internet users are not directly connected to the internet but through a NAT (ie. router).

_Used tech: nodejs, es6 and several libraries retrievable via "npm install [libname]"_
